This codes implements Maxwell's equations in 3+1 with damping.
ie. 8 fields are integrated.

-- Check the value of damping wrt to the divB constraint behavior. Output file fort.101
gives the behavior of (the norm of) the constraint vs time. Run with k_r = 0 (no damping)
and k_r = 1 (damping scale of 1) and compare the obtained behavior. What happens?

-- Implement the force-free equations and see how the solution differs wrt to the
vacuum case.

-- If adventurous, change the current to incorporate anisotropy, and incorporate
a suitable IMEX scheme.
