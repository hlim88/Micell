Here is the list of things of the code.

Makefile.  script to compile the code, simply
type "make" and the code should compile itself.

params.f90 -- define vars for the parameters and 
	      the routine to read them from pars.in

initial.f90 -- defines the initial data. Called by main.f90

evol.f90 -- performs a single step evolution with Runge-Kutta
	    3rd order. Called by main.f90

derivs.f90 -- defines routines to calculate derivatives and
	      has a dissipation operator

boundary.f90 -- defines the boundary condition at the right hand
		 side level.


THe code will produce output to be viewed with xvs.
creates *.sdf files which are then supposed to be sent
to xvs with the command "sdftoxvs file.sdf"
having opened xvs first



**************************************

Take a look at the code, it is just the wave equation with initial
data with a pure left-moving wave.
Examine the boundary conditions (boundary.f90) and what each is doing. 

Write you own output for the norm of the fields. Confirm stability,
choose cfl in the par file to say =4. Check it is unstable.
