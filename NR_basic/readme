Each directory contains a Makefile, which should work for the intel
compiler if you have that. This is how it was tested.

If you only have gfortran, use the Makefile.gnu, e.g.

	make -f Makefile.gnu

instead of just

	make

to compiler your codes.



As a benchmark, the default options in EM result in:

gnu    79.140u 8.840s 1:28.00 99.9%	0+0k 136+16io 2pf+0w
       76.332u 8.272s 1:24.65 99.9%	0+0k 0+16io 0pf+0w     (-march=native)
intel  65.780u 15.600s 1:21.42 99.9%	0+0k 0+32io 0pf+0w
       64.664u 7.352s 1:12.02 99.9%	0+0k 0+32io 0pf+0w     (-march=native)
