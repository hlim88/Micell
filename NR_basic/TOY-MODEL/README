This codes implements a few particular IMEX schemes for the system
(code implemented by Carlos Palenzuela)


V,t = W,x - con*(V - c W)
W,t = V,x

to check that even with arbitrarily large values of con,
the solution is stable.


HOMEWORK:
-- Check the code, the structure of evolve.f90 and add to
it another IMEX method, e.g.  arXiv:0810.1838. SSP2(3,3,2)
